✅ Question 03 – Bash Shell Script (save as answer3.sh)
# Read two strings
echo "Enter the String 1: "
read str1
echo "Enter the String 2: "
read str2

# Get lengths
len1=${#str1}
len2=${#str2}

# Compare and print
if [ $len1 -gt $len2 ];then
 echo "$str1 is larger than str2"
elif [ $len2 -gt $len1 ];then
 echo "$str2 is larger than str1"
else
 echo "Both strings are of equal length"
fi   


//output
Enter the String 1:
apple
Enter the String 2:
banana
banana is larger than str1

//conclusion
The script efficiently compares the lengths of two strings entered by the user, providing clear feedback. It demonstrates basic user input, string manipulation, and conditional logic in Bash scripting.
