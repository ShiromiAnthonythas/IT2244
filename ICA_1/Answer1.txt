This script demonstrates the use of Windows Command Prompt (CMD) commands for file and directory management. It covers essential concepts like navigating directories (`cd`), creating directories (`mkdir`), creating files (`echo`), moving files (`move`), copying directories (`xcopy`), and modifying file attributes (`attrib`). By automating tasks, it highlights how batch scripting can simplify repetitive operations, such as organizing files, creating folder hierarchies, and managing file visibility. This knowledge is foundational for system administration and automation in Windows environments.
