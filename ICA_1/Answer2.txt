✅ Question 02 – Bash Shell Commands (save as answer2.sh)
Assuming data.csv is in the same directory and has a header (e.g., Name,GPA):
# Filter GPA > 3.5
awk -F, 'NR>1 && $4 > 3.5' data.csv

//output
Priya   21    Environmentscience  3.7
Carol   23    Physicalscience     3.99
David   21    IT                  3.98
Riya    22    Physicalscience     3.6
Rahman  21    Environmentscience  3.7
Anna    23    Physicalscience     3.78
Riyas   21    IT                  3.76




# Calculate average GPA
awk -F, 'NR>1 {sum+=$4; count++}
{if (count > 0) print "Average GPA:", sum/count}' data.csv 


//output
Average GPA: 3.511




//sample data
Name	Age	Department	GPA
John	22	Physicalscience	3.5
Priya	21	Environmentscience	3.7
Meera	22	IT	3.1
Carol	23	Physicalscience	3.99
David	21	IT	3.98
Riya	22	Physicalscience	3.6
Rahman	21	Environmentscience	3.7
Rose	22	IT	2
Anna	23	Physicalscience	3.78
Riyas	21	IT	3.76

//conclusion
This Bash script demonstrates how to use `awk` for filtering and analyzing structured data in a CSV file. It effectively extracts rows based on conditions (GPA > 3.5) and computes the average GPA, showcasing the power of shell scripting for data processing and automation in Linux environments.
